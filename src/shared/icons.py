"""The app's pictures: its own icon and logo, the button icons, the flags.

The button icons are Material Symbols, shipped in assets/icons (Apache 2.0 --
see the LICENSE beside them). They are single-colour drawings with no colour
of their own, so they are painted in the theme's text colour, which is also
why they have to be repainted when the theme changes: see `redress`.

Deliberately not the platform's own icons. The app follows the system for one
thing only, light or dark; everything else it draws is Material Design 3, and
a Windows floppy disk next to a Material Symbol looks like a mistake.

A missing picture is never an error. An icon is decoration -- an app that will
not start because a picture is missing is worse than an app with no picture.

# flag in the text needs no file to find and no size to pick.
# A flag for every language the app is built to speak, not only the ones whose
# words ship today. The picker lists what is on disk, so the extra entries sit
# unused rather than showing a flag beside a language nobody can pick -- and
# the day a translation lands, its flag is already here. The one rule the tests
# hold to is the other way round: a shipped language must have a flag, or it
# would appear in the picker with no mark and read as nameless.
