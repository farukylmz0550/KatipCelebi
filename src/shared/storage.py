"""Reading and writing the user's files, without ever losing what is in them.

Everything the app owns is a JSON list of objects in a folder the user picked.
Two rules hold this together, and both were bought the hard way:

Writing is all-or-nothing. A half-written file is how a library gets destroyed,
so a write goes to a temp file next door and is then swapped in with one atomic
rename.

A file we cannot read is NOT an empty file. The two are indistinguishable to
everything downstream, and the app saves as it goes -- so an unreadable file is
about to be overwritten with nothing. It is moved aside first, under a name
that says what happened, and the caller is told.
