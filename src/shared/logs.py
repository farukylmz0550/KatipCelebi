"""Where the app writes down what happened.

The log lives in the library's own folder, beside the books it is about --
so that when somebody asks what went wrong with their library, the answer is
in the same place as the library, and moving one moves the other.

It is rotated. A log nobody ever looks at is a log that grows until it is the
biggest file the user owns.
