"""The one secret the app keeps: an Open Library sign-in, if you save it.

In the operating system's own credential store -- Windows Credential Manager,
the macOS Keychain, the Secret Service on Linux -- never in a file of ours. A
password written to disk is a password anyone with the disk can read; the point
of not storing it in plain text is not met by scrambling it, because the key to
unscramble would have to sit right next to it. Only the OS keeps a secret
properly, so only the OS is asked to.

If there is no such store -- a stripped Linux box, or keyring not
installed -- then nothing is saved and the app asks every time. That is a
smaller convenience, not a broken feature, and it is never a plaintext
fallback.
