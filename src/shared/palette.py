"""One colour in, a whole Material Design 3 palette out.

The seed is the desktop's own accent colour -- the one Windows calls "Accent
colour" and a Linux desktop sets for itself. Nobody is asked to pick it.
Everything else -- every surface, every text colour, the chart wedges -- is
worked out from it by M3's own rules, for the light theme and the dark one
separately. Nothing here is a colour somebody chose by eye, which is the
point: this is what Material You does on a phone, where the wallpaper is the
seed.

The scheme is TonalSpot, M3's everyday variant, and it deliberately calms the
seed down rather than using it raw -- #6750A4 arrives as #655789. That is not
a bug to fix; it is what makes an arbitrary accent liveable across a whole
window.

The one Qt in this file is reading that accent, which only Qt knows.
