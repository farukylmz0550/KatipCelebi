"""Every word the user reads, in the language they chose.

The words live in assets/lang, one JSON file per language. The code never
holds a phrase: it calls text("nav_add"), and this module hands back "Add
Book" or "Kitap Ekle" depending on the language in force.

English is the ground truth. Every other language is read on top of it, so a
key a translator has not got to yet falls back to English rather than showing
its own name -- a screen half in Turkish reads better than one with "nav_add"
on a button.

Adding a language is adding a file. The picker lists whatever is in the
folder; no code here names the languages it will ever have.
