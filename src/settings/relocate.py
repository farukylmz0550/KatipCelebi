"""Moving a library from one folder to another.

All of it or none of it. The old version moved the files one at a time and
merely reported which ones failed -- so a library that stopped half way was a
library in two places, with the app still reading the half-empty one and
writing a second, diverging copy into it. Anything that fails here is put back
before this function returns.
