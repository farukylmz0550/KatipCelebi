"""What your library adds up to.

Every number the statistics page shows is worked out here, from the books
themselves. Nothing is stored and nothing is cached: a total that is kept
somewhere is a total that can be wrong, and this way correcting a book
corrects the figures at once.

No Qt in this file. The page draws what these functions return.
