"""Asking Open Library about a book.

Open Library is a wiki: anyone can edit any record, and the schema is a
suggestion. A field documented as a list of strings may hold a null, a number,
a {'value': ...} wrapper, or a bare string. So nothing here trusts the shape of
what comes back -- every field is read on its own, and an odd one costs that
field rather than the book.
