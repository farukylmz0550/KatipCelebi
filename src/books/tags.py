"""Tags: what a book is about.

A tag is stored folded to lower case and shown with a capital, so "Science
fiction", "science fiction" and "SCIENCE FICTION" are one tag rather than
three. Nothing is translated here -- the app speaks one language today -- but
storing a settled form is what makes translating possible later without going
back over everybody's library.

The other half of this file is about Open Library. Its `subjects` list mixes
two different things: what a book is about, and how a shop or a cataloguer
files it. Only the first kind is a tag worth having.
