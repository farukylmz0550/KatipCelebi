"""What is known about a book: the half that came from the catalogue.

Read-only until you ask to change it. A lookup fills these in, but a lookup
gets things wrong -- a typo in a title, an author's name the wrong way round --
and there was no way to correct one without deleting the book and starting
over. The Edit button opens every field at once; Save writes them, Cancel
forgets them.

It works the same way as the personal panel: it holds the book's key, not the
book, and asks the library for the current one whenever it needs it.
