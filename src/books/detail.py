"""One book's own page.

Only the frame: the cover, the title, and the three panels that do the work --
what the catalogue knows (facts), what you make of it (personal), and where the
book is (lending). Saving lives here, in one place, so that no panel has to
decide for itself what a refused write looks like.

A page in the main window rather than a window of its own. It is opened by the
window, which puts it on the stack and takes it off again when `closed` fires.
