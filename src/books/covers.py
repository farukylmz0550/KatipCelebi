"""Fetching cover pictures without making the user wait for them.

Everything drawn here -- the cropped covers and the placeholder panels -- is
made at the screen's real pixel density, not at the logical size the layout
asks for. On a 150%-scaled display a "150x210" panel is really 225x315
physical pixels; drawing it at 150x210 and letting Qt stretch it is how a
cover comes out soft next to crisp text. See `_device_ratio`.
